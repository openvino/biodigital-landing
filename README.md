# BioDigital Certification

BioDigital Certificationâ„¢ is a process for producers to self-certify their product claims. Wineries can use it to certify wines and grape production for diverse claims, such as organic, biodynamic, vegan, DO, AOC, IG, fair-trade, carbon neutral, C2C, single-vineyard, and natural.

## Key Features

* **Unambiguous Claim Descriptions:** Clear rules and requirements for each certification type.
* **Digital Artifacts:** Wineries publish evidence of compliance on OpenVino.
* **Decentralized Challenges:** Claims can be challenged via Kleros.io arbitration service.
* **Digital Badges:** Producers receive digital badges upon successful certification.

## Problem Solved

BioDigital Certification addresses issues with existing certification systems, including:

* **Misaligned incentives:** Current systems can be easily manipulated.
* **High costs:** Traditional certification processes are expensive.
* **Inefficiency:** Existing methods are often time-consuming and ineffective.
* **Confusing labels:** Consumers are overwhelmed by numerous, often unverified claims.
* **Varying standards:** Different standards across regions create additional costs.

## Certification Components

* **Data Publication:** Wineries publish compliance data on OpenVino.Exchange.
* **Data Validation:** Bloock is used for data validation.
* **Certification Badges:** Kleros manages the issuance of certification badges.

## User Roles and Needs

The project focuses on two primary user roles:

* **Wineries (Self-Certifiers):** Seek a cheaper, more efficient certification process and protection against fraudulent claims.
* **Challengers:**  Can be other wineries, consumers, influencers, regulators, or "bounty hunters" motivated by financial incentives, market curation, community engagement, or other factors. They challenge potentially invalid claims.

## Challenge Mechanism

* **Staking:** Wineries stake a bounty (e.g., in ETH or potentially wine tokens) for a 30-day challenge period. Challengers also stake funds.
* **Multiple Challengers (Under Consideration):**  The possibility of multiple simultaneous challengers is being explored, with potential benefits for revenue generation and troll reduction.  A final decision is pending.
* **Kleros Arbitration:** Kleros jurors review evidence and decide the outcome.
* **Rewards:**  The winning party receives the bounty (or a portion thereof in a multi-challenger scenario).  A portion of the challenger's stake is distributed to Kleros and OpenVino.
* **Probation Period:**  Wineries have a period (e.g., 30 days) during which their claims can be challenged.

## Open Questions and Considerations

* **Wine Token Staking:** The feasibility of wineries staking their own wine tokens is being evaluated.
* **Challenge Process Details:**  Specifics of the challenge process, including the handling of multiple challengers and the distribution of stakes, are still under discussion.
* **Legal and Regulatory Compliance:**  The project is working to ensure compliance with relevant regulations and secure recognition from regulatory bodies like SENASA.
* **User Experience:**  The user interface is being designed with simplicity and clarity in mind, especially for non-crypto native users.
* **Smart Contract Security:** Security audits are a priority.
